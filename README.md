# ShModBot

A Moderational Telegram bot, tailored to a specific group.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/ColinTheShark/shmodbot.git`)
2. Create an `shmodbot.ini` (from [`shmodbot.sample`](shmodbot.sample)) and fill the values correctly.
3. Start the bot with `python -m shmodbot`

## Configuration

There isn't much to configure. Most settings are hard-coded since the bot is tailored
to a single group (and its admin group).

If you need to use the Bot for your own group and you change the values and logic, you
will need to release your changed sourcecode in accordance to the [License](#License).
